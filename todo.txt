To do:

    1) set up directory to do automatically

    2) run regression to get sector x time dummies
        a. smoothed plot of coefficients (maybe just big ones?)
        b. repeat 3 table with 2022 elements?
        c. regress log(exad) on time as well as MU and xad

    3) Quantifying error stuff

    4) Correcting markups stuff
